To get the model, we just use the simplest way of linear regression. Firstly, we randomly separate the dataset into train and test dataset with a ratio of 7:3. 

- Train Indices: 12,  48,  86,  29,  94,   6,  67,  66,  36,  17,  50,  35,   8,
             96,  28,  20,  82,  26,  63,  14,  25,   4,  18,  39,   9,  79,
              7,  65,  37,  90,  57, 100,  55,  44,  51,  68,  47,  69,  62,
             98,  80,  42,  59,  49,  99,  58,  76,  33,  95,  60,  64,  85,
             38,  30,   2,  53,  22,   3,  24,  88,  92,  75,  87,  83,  21,
             61,  72,  15,  93,  52
- Test Indices: 84, 54, 71, 46, 45, 40, 23, 81, 11,  1, 19, 31, 74, 34, 91,  5, 77,
            78, 13, 32, 56, 89, 27, 43, 70, 16, 41, 97, 10, 73

Then we fit the linear regression model by computing:

$\beta = (X^TX)^{-1}X^Ty$, and round the result into 6 decimal points, which yields that:

$$
M(x_1,x_2,x_3) = 1937.964582 -5.157235 x_1 + 496.6025 x_2 + 1116.807677 x_3
$$

We also compute the evaluation metrics:\
